# Enhancing Affective EEG Signal Analysis Through Adaptive Resolution Graph Clustering

## About the Project

This project aims to advance the field of affective computing by improving the accuracy and efficiency of emotion recognition using electroencephalography (EEG) signals. By integrating adaptive resolution graph clustering with advanced signal processing techniques, we propose a novel approach to analyze complex EEG data, enabling more nuanced identification of emotional states.

### Background

Emotion recognition plays a pivotal role in affective computing, impacting various applications from healthcare to interactive technology. Traditional EEG-based emotion recognition systems face challenges due to the complexity and variability of brain signals. Our research addresses these challenges by employing adaptive resolution graph clustering, enhancing the granularity and computational efficiency of EEG signal analysis.

## Research Objectives

- To develop an adaptive resolution graph clustering framework for EEG data analysis.
- To improve the accuracy and computational efficiency of emotion recognition from EEG signals.
- To validate our approach using publicly available EEG datasets and compare its performance with existing methodologies.
